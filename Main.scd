 *
 * A grain synthesizer with two modes and multiple layers. Can be controlled via MIDI or GUI.
 * One mode (Land) overlays multiple channels with slightly different generation rates,
 * that creates modulations between layers for interesting soundscapes, and one mode
 * that is a classic grain synthesizer, one is a simple frequency modulation.
 *
 * Multiple samples can be chosen, that all have to be loaded on startup

 *
 * To run the program you have to evaluate the code in this file, i.e. place
 * your cursor somwhere below the open parenthesis below and press Ctrl + Enter
 * (or CMD + Enter on Mac). A Dialogue will open to select samples, if you want
 * to preload samples without dialoge, you can do so in the file Samples.scd
 *
 * If you want to save your configuration of Synths and parameters, press "save"
 * on the main control panel, a dialogue will open.
 *
 * To record sound, press record, sound will be recorded immediately to the Recordings
 * directory in you working folder, press again to stop recording.
 *
 * MIDI MAPPINGS
 * Midi CC messages control the layer of the channel on which they are sent, so a message on
 * ch0 controls the synth on ch0. The control numbers can be set differently in the file Midi.scd
 * cc num		30		31			32			33			34		35		36		37		39
 * control		size	size_spray	position	pos_spray	density	vol		pan		buffer	freq_spray
