# computergrain
A grain synthesizer with two modes and multiple layers. Can be controlled via MIDI or GUI.
One mode overlays multiple channels with slightly different generation rates,
that creates modulations between layers for interesting soundscapes, and one mode
that is a classic grain synthesizer.

Multiple buffers can be chosen, that all have to be loaded on startup

To use it, download the file computergrain.sc and open it in the [SuperCollider IDE](https://supercollider.github.io/).
More instruction on how to run are in the file.
